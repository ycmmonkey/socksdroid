ChiselSocksDroid
==========

- This a fork of a fork of a fork of a fork of SocksDroid to add [chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) support.
- All existing features of SocksDroid remain usable.
- The chisel client always runs with port:socks and --keepalive 30s as this is intended to be used like a vpn, and I found it unusable without keepalive. Most of the other supported options for chisel client can be added from a basic UI.
- Has a quick settings tile and a notification action for fasterrr access.
- Has cute programming socks as its icon.
